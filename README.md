## List filtering

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Examples
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

## Parity Checker

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Examples

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)

## Vowel Count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## Who likes it

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes([]) # must be "no one likes this"
likes(["Peter"]) # must be "Peter likes this"
likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) # must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) # must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) # must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

## Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

    Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

## Digital Root

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
16 --> 1 + 6 = 7
942 --> 9 + 4 + 2 = 15 --> 1 + 5 = 6
132189 --> 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24 --> 2 + 4 = 6
493193 --> 4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29 --> 2 + 9 = 11 --> 1 + 1 = 2

## Detect Pangram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Jaden String Casing

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

## Build Tower

Build Tower by the following given argument:
number of floors (integer and always greater than 0).

Tower block is represented as \*

Python: return a list;
JavaScript: returns an Array;
C#: returns a string[];
PHP: returns an array;
C++: returns a vector<string>;
Haskell: returns a [String];
Ruby: returns an Array;
Lua: returns a Table;
Have fun!

for example, a tower of 3 floors looks like below

[
' * ',
' *** ',
'*****'
]
and a tower of 6 floors looks like below

[
' \* ',
' **\* ',
' \*\*\*** ',
' **\*\*\*** ',
' ****\***** ',
'****\*\*\*****'

## Square Every Digit

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

## Calculate BMI

Write function bmi that calculates body mass index (bmi = weight / height2).

if bmi <= 18.5 return "Underweight"

if bmi <= 25.0 return "Normal"

if bmi <= 30.0 return "Overweight"

if bmi > 30 return "Obese"


## Create Phone Number
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example:
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
